1) read a value from the PModIA
- check with Sarkar on pinout
- I need to know the exact order and requirement of how to read from the
PModIA, based on the AD5933 datasheet... or look through the old code?
let's stick with the datasheet for now
- 1) enter standby mode by issuing standby command to control register
- 1.5) program a frequency to start at. Let's do 1 kHz okay
- 1.75) set the other parameters for the frequency sweep
- 2) enter initialize mode by issuing an initialize with start frequency
     command to control register. This allows for setting time before
     freq. sweep

So great, I'm getting some data, now let's see if it's the right data
2) convert to conventional values
- 1) what is the equation to go from return to ohms? any calibration?
- 2) The current to voltage amplifier is a 20kOhm on the PModIA
     I believe that the calibration is one chosen by user
     Let's try a 10k cal. with 20k gain, and then test against a 20k cal.

So, numbers look like it might be doing what I want. Now let's verify
Let's read some data sheet to see what I should be calibrating with.
I know the 4 to 5 is a 20kOhm

So... there's a whole bloody library for the PModIA that I missed...
Let's start from the beginning an check it out
